Developed portfolio websiteâ€”a multifaceted platform that showcases my identity as a student, developer, and designer. The website encapsulates a modern design ethos, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices. The use of HTML5 and CSS3 forms the backbone of the site, providing a responsive and visually engaging layout. JavaScript and jQuery bring dynamic elements to life, including a sticky navigation bar, scroll-up button, and captivating typing text animation powered by Typed.js. The projects section is elevated by the Owl Carousel, offering an interactive display of my featured works. Google Fonts, FontAwesome icons, and custom styling contribute to the overall aesthetic appeal. With a mobile-first approach and meticulous application of media queries, the website ensures optimal functionality on all screen sizes. Git and GitHub are integral to version control and collaborative development. This project reflects my commitment to delivering a polished, visually appealing, and functionally robust digital presence.
